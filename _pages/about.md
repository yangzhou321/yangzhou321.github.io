<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='kN8pdxcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C'></span></strong> [**Project**](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/wsdong/Projects/VQSA.htm)

**Abstract:** Inspired by sparse representation in image restoration, we opt to address the degraded image recognition problem by learning image-quality-independent feature representation in a simple plug-and-play manner, that is, to introduce discrete vector quantization (VQ) to remove redundancy in recognition models.

[Self-feature Distillation with Uncertainty Modeling for Degraded Image Recognition](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20053-3_32)

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='kN8pdxcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC'></span></strong> [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=kN8pdxcAAAAJ&citation_for_view=kN8pdxcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC)

**Abstract:** In standard feature distillation, Mean Squared Error, MSE treats each pixel in the feature equally and may result in relatively poor reconstruction performance in some difficult regions. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-feature distillation method with uncertainty modeling for better producing HQ-like features from low-quality observations in this paper.
