[Vector Quantization with Self-Attention for Quality-Independent Representation Learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Yang_Vector_Quantization_With_Self-Attention_for_Quality-Independent_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf)

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='kN8pdxcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C'></span></strong> [**Project**](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/wsdong/Projects/VQSA.htm)

**Abstract:** Inspired by sparse representation in image restoration, we opt to address the degraded image recognition problem by learning image-quality-independent feature representation in a simple plug-and-play manner, that is, to introduce discrete vector quantization (VQ) to remove redundancy in recognition models.

[Self-feature Distillation with Uncertainty Modeling for Degraded Image Recognition](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20053-3_32)

**Zhou Yang**, Weisheng Dong*, Xin Li, Jinjian Wu, Leida Li and Guangming Shi 

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='kN8pdxcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC'></span></strong> [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=kN8pdxcAAAAJ&citation_for_view=kN8pdxcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC)

**Abstract:** In standard feature distillation, Mean Squared Error, MSE treats each pixel in the feature equally and may result in relatively poor reconstruction performance in some difficult regions. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-feature distillation method with uncertainty modeling for better producing HQ-like features from low-quality observations in this paper.

BrickPal: Assembly as Language, Immersive and Gamification, In-situ Creation


Xiaofeng Zhang, **Zhou Yang**, Xiao Tang, Yao Shi, Hongni Ye, Yi Wu and Ran Zhang

[**Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BBnm8yBUSg&t=1s)

**Introduction:** We have developed an application using AR glasses for assisting assembly on the Unity Vuforia platform. This program also utilizes NLP technology to predict the next assembly step and supports user-defined assembly requirements. My main contribution is the assembly guidance using AR technology.
